the main question is below:
### in page4 proposition 1
$$ 
0 \in \nabla_i{f(\bar{x})} - v_i + \partial{\phi _i(\bar{x_i}) } \qquad i \in [m]
$$

but the derivation of 
$$ <y_i,x>+\phi _i(x) + \frac{\gamma}{2} \left\| \bar{x_i}-x \right\| _i^2 
$$
is 
$$ 
y_i+ \partial \phi_i(\bar{x_i})+\gamma_i(x_i-x)=\nabla_i{f(\bar{x})} - v_i + \partial{\phi _i(\bar{x_i}) }+\gamma_i(x_i-x)
$$

is different from the paper's conclusion.

### in page4 proposition 1
we have 
$$ 
<u_i,\bar{x_i}> + \phi _i(x_i)\geq \min _{x \in R^{d_i}} \left\{ <u_i,x>+\phi _i(x)+\frac{\gamma_i}{2}\left\| \bar{x_i}-x \right\| _i^2
\right\}
$$


why this inequality holds in the situation.
